            <h3><b style="font-size:40px">How To Make Accordion Potatoes?</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size:30px"><u>Step 1:</u> Peel the potatoes. Then, cut the ends of the potatoes.<br>
                    Cut the potato lengthwise into 1/4 to 3/8 inch slices. Do not cut larger than 1/2 inch. <br>
                    Larger slices are slightly harder to manipulate and also do not get as crispy when baked.</li><br>

                    <li style="font-size:30px"><u>Step 2:</u> Place the potato horizontally. Place the skewer on both sides of the potato.<br>
                         Use skewers as a base so that you do not cut all the way through the potato and cut vertical lines. <br>
                         Keep the lines close to each other so you make the accordion shape. <br>
                        (For those that like to get technical, try to keep the lines no more than 1/16 inches apart.)</li><br>

                        <li style="font-size:30px"><u>Step 3:</u> In the same fashion, flip the potato over and cut diagonal lines. </li><br>

                        <li style="font-size:30px"><u>Step 4:</u> Push the skewer through the potato. <br>
                            (I find it best to leave the potato on the cutting board,<br>
                            place my hand over the potato to hold it down, and gently push the skewer through the center of the potato.<br>
                             Please be careful so that you do not pierce yourself with the skewer.) <br>
                            Gently stretch out the potato, starting with the bottom and work towards the middle. </li><br>

                            <li style="font-size:30px"><u>Step 5 :</u> While you are slicing the potatoes, keep the potatoes that you have already cut in cold water.<br>
                                This helps to keep the potatoes from turning brown. <br>
                                This also helps to break down the excess starch which will help make delicious crispy potatoes when they are baked.</li><br>

                                <li style="font-size:30px"><u>Step 6:</u> Now, brush the garlic-herb butter onto both sides of the potatoes.</li><br>
                                <li style="font-size:30px"><u>Step 7:</u> Now Fry them or Air Fry them at 375 degree Farenheit and Server them with Ketchup. </li><br>
            </ul>
